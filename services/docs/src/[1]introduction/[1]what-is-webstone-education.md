# What is Webstone Education?

Webstone Education is the only comprehensive full-stack learning environment where you learn everything from HTML to databases and anything in-between.

Not only that, the entire learning experience is based on a project so you have full context of what you do, why you do it and how you can apply it to your work or personal projects.

But wait, it gets better! You [define your own curriculum](./[3]build-your-own-curriculum.md), based on the technology stack you want to learn about :tada:!
