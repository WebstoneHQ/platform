# Build your own curriculum (BYOC)

Do you prefer React, Angular, or Svelte? What about REST vs GraphQL? Oh... have we talked about your preferred backend technology or database yet?!

Right? It gets complicated quickly :sweat_smile:.

That's why Webstone Education lets you build your own curriculum. You get to choose your own technologies & frameworks for the following areas of a full-stack application:

| Area         | Example choices                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Web**      | Svelte, React, Angular, etc.              |
| **Styling**  | Tailwind CSS, CSS, styledcomponents, etc. |
| **API type** | REST or GraphQL                           |
| **API**      | SvelteKit, Next.js, Rust, Java, etc.      |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.          |

At the initial launch in spring 2022, we will provide the following two options:

1. SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, REST API, PostgreSQL
1. Next.js, Tailwind CSS, REST API, PostgreSQL

Further options will be developed by industry experts based on demand as measured by what people configure at [webstone.app](https://webstone.app).
