# Getting Started

You can get started in three steps:

1. Navigate to [webstone.app](https://webstone.app)
1. Build your own curriculum ([learn more](./[3]build-your-own-curriculum.md))
1. Start learning

For each course you take, Webstone Education creates a [personalized repository](../[2]architecture/[3]student-repositories.md) for you where you can write the application code based on the lessons provided to you.
