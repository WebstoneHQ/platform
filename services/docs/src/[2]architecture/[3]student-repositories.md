# Student Repositories

As discussed in the [build your own curriculum (BYOC) section](../[1]introduction/[3]build-your-own-curriculum.md), students define their own technology stack.

When a student selected their tech stack and is ready to start a course, Webstone Education creates a personalized repository in the student's git provider of choice. The repository contains the modules a student selected and all lessons to complete the course. All of this uses the tech stack a student selected.

## Course updates

It is inevitable that the course material will be outdated. This may happen an hour after the student repo is created or a few weeks down the road.

Webstone Education provides a low-effort, seamless solution to keep all courses up-to-date :point_down:.

Webstone Education updates courses regularly to leverage the latest versions of the frameworks used, but also to continue to provide best practices as they evolve over time.

When Webstone Education updates a course module, the system notifies students who use that module in their course. At that point, students see what changed compared to the code they have in their student repository. Detailed notes of what changed and why will be provided to ensure students understand what is new.

Once students understand the updates, they can apply the changes to their code â€” either manually or let the system do it automatically.

## New lessons

Courses continue to evolve and new lessons will be introduced over time. For example, a new "Security" lesson may be added. To apply these new lessons to student repositories, Webstone Education follows the same concept as described in the [Course updates](#course-updates) section above.
